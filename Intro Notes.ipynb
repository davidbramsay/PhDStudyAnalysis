    "For new data, we need to run `python3 process_tetris_vids.py`.  It will only process new videos (no existing video_meta pickle).  This video_meta pickle is wrong atm, because it uses the timestamp in the filename as the start time, but the filename includes the last timestamp of the video.  We need to subtract the video duration from these timestamps before using them.  We should do this upon opening, so that we don't have ambiguous state in the meta file (it takes a really long time to run); or we could create meta_corrected.  The output here is a DF with timestamps based on OCRing the screen, looking for GAME OVER, PAUSE, etc, such that we know when the user is playing and when they lose.  We can assume they are more 'in the zone' the further into the game they are, and that they are not 'in the zone' when on the pause/game over screen.\n",

    "We run `Step 0a. Sess1and2 Processing` to process sess1 and sess2.  This does a whole host of things (hopefully)-- cleans up and processes the units of all incoming data (i.e. creates temperature plots from raw data, converts units for gyro/accel, etc), chops the E4 data to match each individual CSV session, runs a kalman filter on the accelerometer/gyro data, processes the survey data (make sure all scale are 1 indexed, process basic info about BIT and TAS, for example), pull out timings (Noticed, start/end transitions), generates flow drawings from user input, and saves everything as correctly timestamped DFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing this, we make sure we have exactly what we expect in terms of CSVs for each user/session.  Some of the sessions had brief pauses or restarts; we clean these up first and move them to the 'raw_csv' folder inside each session if there is a need to do pre-cleaning.  The data import script also is not robust to failures; we need to check data output and make sure everything has made it into the final DF, and fix it if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "To process Session 3, we use `Step 0b. Sess3 Processing`.  This pulls E4 data and puts it in DFs, pulls the relevant data between watch button presses from the CSVS in 'P<N>_sess3', and generates a timing df (start, start transition, end transition, noticed)."
