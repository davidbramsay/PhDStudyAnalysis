    "\n",
    "For accelerometer data at the wrist, we might want to do a few things: (1) look over a time window and make a judgement about wrist movement-- is it a lot, or a little?  We may want to use that movement as a signal for how much we should trust the other sensors, which are contact based and can be pretty corrupted by motion artifacts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can transform these three axes of motion into a vector, and see how different it is from an estimated gravity vector (resting, some stillness assumptions, etc).  Wrist stillness *may* tell us something about focus state, but probably not too much directly unless someone was engaged passively in something.  Perhaps the most interesting thing we could draw from it are patterns in the data, which summary statistics would destroy.  We can do a self-similarity matrix-style approach to build out some statistics on patterns in the accelerometer data\n",

Maybe there is some interesting stuff in the raw signal, but that's out of scope.  Whats probably useful (if anything) is looking to see if the raw data looks trustworthy, and to check if we trust empatica's derivation of HR and IBI.  By running our own algorithm on the raw data, we might have a sense of confidence in our results.  We can also take into consideration the Accelerometer data once it's been transformed to a simple 'magnitude of motion' measure. \n",

We may want to assess the quality of BVP and their HR algorithm on our own to see how well they're doing; we may also want to throw away data when motion is an issue.  This derived signal lends itself easily to summary stats/time slices.\n",
